    "__Cleaning the first dataset__, `data-table.csv`, is fairly straightforward, since the dataset is already in good shape. The only steps we need to take are:\n",
    "- Filter out the columns that we definitely won’t need; in this case, it will be `URL`.\n",
    "- Only keep rows that satisfy our research criteria, meaning the data collected must be from California (`STATE` == 'CA') and obtained between 2016 and 2022 (2016 <= `YEAR` <= 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cleaning the second dataset__, `rates-of-preventable-hospitalizations-for-selected-medical-conditions-by-county-.csv`, involves a bit more work. To start, we want to keep only the rows within our study range, which is from 2016 to 2022. Then, we filtered out some irrelevant columns like `Count_ICD9` and `Population_ICD9`, as these variables are based on older criteria before 2016 and contain only empty values after the new criteria were applied. Next, we need to exclude any hospitalization records caused by conditions unrelated to diabetes. In our case, there are only four diabetes-related conditions, so it’s actually quicker to use `isin` to include them, rather than excluding the others. Afterward, by using `info()`, we noticed an anomaly with a non-null value in one of the annotation columns. We looked into that specific observation and realized it was just a period showing in that column, so it wasn’t a major issue. As a second-to-last step, we further filtered out some columns that may not be helpful for our research questions, such as `RiskAdjRate_ICD10` and the annotation columns mentioned above. Finally, we used `shape`, `info()`, and `describe()` to ensure that our cleaned data is indeed in good format."

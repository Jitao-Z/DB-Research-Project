# Database Research Project
Short description: this is a database research project for analyzing diabetes condition in California population

## What are our research questions?
We will explore how diabetes has impacted the health of the Californian population from 2016 to 2022, as measured by the number of hospitalizations and deaths.

We will be conducting this research question in three specific directions:
1. Is there a relationship between the number of deaths due to diabetes in California with respect to the number of hospitalizations related to diabetes and the at-risk population using data from 2016 to 2022?
2. Is there any county that had the highest mean diabetes-related hospitalization rate for more than three years between 2016 and 2022? 
3. Among short-term complications, long-term complications, uncontrolled diabetes, and composite diabetes-related conditions, which category is the largest proportion in diabetes-related mortality in California from 2016 to 2022?

## Why are we interested in this series of research questions?
Diabetes is a chronic disease with significant health and economic burdens. As a highly populated and diverse state, California has a substantial number of diabetes cases each year. We are interested in this series of research questions because monitoring the relationship between diabetes-related mortality and hospitalizations due to the same cause can alert people to the severe consequences of this disease and emphasize the importance of proper prevention.

Our research can contribute to identifying patterns related to diabetes from 2016 to 2022. Also, it may help predict diabetes-related mortality trends in California. By combining this data with information on diabetes across different counties, we can extract regional differences and county-level variations. Our findings may provide insights into potential predictors of diabetes-related mortality and help inform strategies to reduce preventable hospitalizations.
